      <h1>Ours for the Taking</h1>
      <p>by A.C. Buchanan</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>You are the first child to be born on Atema Six. Your birth heralds a boom that transforms this new world from base to colony, from a workplace to a home. Within months, the corridors are full of burbling and screaming, of sleep-hazed parents; a few months more and time is punctuated by the stomping of tiny feet on the reinforced glass, as you learn to walk in a gravity your small bodies have not evolved for. Schedules are reworked and the rooms designated for a nursery and school are cleared. The volume of messages back to Earth triples. Some wonder if they have made a terrible mistake, trying to live out here, if this is really a place to raise children. Others feel as if they have finally come home.</p>
      <p>For you, this is the only world you know and if you were to leave - as you may do one day - you may become disorientated, homesick, as your parents were on the long journey and their first months here. You can’t articulate it yet, but you know this place, this sprawling network of reinforced glass rooms and corridors above the swirling gas below, the tremors that bounce through you each time the extraction platform is raised and lowered, the smell of decontamination fluids that springs to every adult you know; this, this is your home.</p>
      <p>Every few months a tanker arrives. The screens in the corridors count down the hours, and on the day the corridors are hung with streamers, and lollies are hidden around the common areas for you to find. Once unloading is complete, the adults gather for wine and cake in the canteen. You’re allowed to stay up all night while the tankers are here, but usually you fall asleep watching cartoons with your friends and are carried into bed, ice-cream wiped gently from your face.</p>
      <p>Tankers bring more than celebration with them; there are also new clothes, food supplies, and replacement parts for non-essential systems which have deteriorated since the last visit. Sometimes there’s a teacher, who will stay until the next ship, interspersing your programme of remote learning with new stories.</p>
